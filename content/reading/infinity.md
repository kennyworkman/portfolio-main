Deutsch is so fucking smart. Lots of thinking about thinking - why a [tradition
of criticism](/writing/bad_philosophy) is crucial to knowledge creation and why
such a process is unbounded. 

An intuitive, non-mathematical explanation for the multiverse and quantum
mechanics. A rich but fabricated dialogue between Socrates (assuming that
Deutsch got a bit carried away with the personification) and Hermes. An
inspirational call to dredge deep space for raw mass to build space stations.

Probably going to read again, lots over the head.
