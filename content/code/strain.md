Under the mentorship of [Henrique De
Paoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrique-c-de-paoli-9a188111/), I engineered a
strain of _E. coli_ with "switch-like" control over its endogenous expression of
vectors. 

A construct was assembled to integrate this behavior into the bacterial
chromosome through a
[transposon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element).  Using
standard molecular biology benchwork - Assembly PCR, gel electrophoresis, and
Gibson assembly - library of novel strains was gathered.

Though the work is ongoing under the Synthetic Biology Informatics group at
[JBEI](https://www.jbei.org/), initial results were promising, showing marked increase in host vector
production when induced.
