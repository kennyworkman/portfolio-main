High-throughput synthetic biology pipelines of any kind will require "reading"
many DNA constructs, and when dealing with a
[library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(biology)) of reasonable size,
this sequencing process can quickly become complex. 

While interning at the JointBioEnergy Institute, I worked with [Henrique De
Paoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrique-c-de-paoli-9a188111/) to develop
some proof of concept tools to automate the processing and screening of next generation
sequencing (NGS) data. I develop two different libraries to this end.

  * [Iteration 1](https://github.com/kennyworkman/visual_pipeline) with a heavy
emphasis on shell scripting with some auxiliary python.

  * [Iteration
2](https://github.com/kennyworkman/colony-visual/tree/master/cvisual) with a more
robust object-orientated approach with documentation and unit-testing.

These libraries produce excel spreadsheets containing digestible summary
statistics of sequencing. The motivation here is to bridge the gap between the
computational and bench scientist in data interpretation.

Like other processes in the high-level BioFoundry, the closer we come to
automating and abstracting away constituent pieces of the
[Design-Build-Test-Learn
process](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0076-9), the faster we can
build more layers of complexity on our "bio stack".
