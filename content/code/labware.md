I used a data structure architecture largely [inspired by
git](https://blog.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/).

A detailed breakdown of implementation, design choices, and an API specification
can be found in the linked documentation.

The
heavy lifting here was getting this state to persist when the runtime memory was
wiped, such that data can be retrieved with linear complexity. What we end up
with is, in effect, a hash map implemented directly onto the nix-flavor filesystem with
keys derived from compressed object binaries.


Here is a quick use case with the exposed API via the python interpretor. 


```
>>> rad = registry.get("Rad")
>>> rad
Bio-Rad-HSP9601B with length 127.76 mm, width 85.48 mm, height 16.06 mm, and 96 wells. >>> rad.plate
Plate with length 127.76 mm, width 85.48 mm, height 16.06 mm, and 96 wells.
>>> rad.well
Well with volume 200 uL, depth 14.81 mm, top diameter 5.46 mm, and bottom diameter 2.
˓→64 mm.
>>> rad.plate.well_num 96
```
