This is the skyline of the 1893 World's Fair. Hundreds of buildings erected in
the image of neoclassical perfection, expositions and showmanship of real
advances in physics and engineering on display for the curious public.

There was this alignment among the public in general to _do_.

People were hungry for progress on the scale of civilizations. People unironically
had conversations about the "advancement of mankind" without sounding tone deaf
and pretentious.

*Placeholder* for notes on Tesla, Edison, Westinghouse. People who changed the
actual landscape of the world, who had ambition and vision far beyond anything
I've seen today. I think we have a lot to learn from these people.

I also think it was easier to invent and work at the SOTA in the late 19th and
early 20th century. Edison could open an electrical engineering journal and
digest advances in circuits with simple algebra. The equivalent in any
cutting-edge field of computer science requires years of math and theory...
