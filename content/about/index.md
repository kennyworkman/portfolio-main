I am dedicating my life to making biology easier to engineer.

I both want to understand how the world works at its core and build huge systems
that change how we interact (or think) about living things.


I studied Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at
Berkeley. I dropped out to work on a stealth startup with pre-seed
investment from [Lucy Guo](https://lucy.ws/), [the
House](https://thehouse.fund/), and [Tyler
Cowen](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

I'm currently reading generally about or working on projects relating to:

  * distributed + serverless computing
  * bayesian statistics
  * [sparse coding](http://www.rctn.org/bruno/papers/highly-overcomplete-SPIE.pdf)
  * [capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06818)
  * microservice architectures (mostly K8s)
  * early 1800s American history and the great inventors
  * [coding schemes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283929v1.full.pdf)  w.r.t biological sequence 
  * [information theory + evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13475)

Reading list [here](/reading).

A lot of progress has been stalled because people aren’t ambitious enough or
diversely technical. [Social cancer](https://facebook.com) and [(misaligned)
incentives](https://janestreet.com) certainly don’t
help.

There’s a very real and unique opportunity to rewrite history over the next few
decades. Computing (the serverless kind), statistics (the ml kind), and
automation (the non-grad student kind) are doing something special in a field
that has been more qualitative then quantitative since its birth.

Please reach out if you want to work on these problems for real.
