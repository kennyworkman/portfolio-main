I'm a software engineer and synthetic biologist with a firm belief in
building from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle).
I'm trying to develop systems and tools to engineer living systems from
scratch. 

I studied Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at
Berkeley. I dropped out to work on a stealth startup with pre-seed
investment from [Lucy Guo](https://lucy.ws/), [the
House](https://thehouse.fund/), and [Tyler
Cowen](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

I'm currently reading generally about or working on projects relating to:

  * Distributed computing
  * Bayesian statistics
  * Capsule neural nets
  * Microservice infrastructure (mostly K8s)
  * early 1800s American history and the great inventors
  * Attention and biological sequences


Reading list [here](/reading).
