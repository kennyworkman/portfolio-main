I am dedicating my life to making biology easier to engineer. 

There’s a very real and unique opportunity to [rewrite
history](https://kenbw.com/writing/biocompute/) over the next few
decades. Computing, statistical tooling (what the misguided call "AI"??) and
high-throughput + miniaturized assays are providing an opportunity. 

Those with comparatively less resources but considerably more capability than
[the incumbent](https://pfizer.com) will rebuild biotech from scratch, ushering
in a new age of consumer biologics, synthetic life forms, and personalized
therapeutics.

The visible cadence of progress has been stalled because people aren’t ambitious
enough or diversely technical. [Social cancer](https://facebook.com) and
[(misaligned) incentives](https://janestreet.com) certainly don’t help.

However, there has never been a better time in history to try to _actually_ engineer
biology.

("Bioengineering" as a field or profession is a tragic misnomer and university
graduates flaunting this title are frankly neither good engineers nor good
scientists. They are good at memorizing words however, which might be
important.)

And while dreams of [civilization scale
progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition) and a
collective drive for understanding have largely died with my generation,
where the [great
physicists](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/)
have been eschewed for head bobbing Tik Tok idiots, there is still hope for a
future of progress.

We have the library of Alexandria on our mobile phones and the collective body
of scientific literature at our [fingertips](https://sci-hub-links.com/).
What's keeping a [team of polyglot programmers](https://latchbio.com) with
strong mathematical priors from consuming the world with synthetic
biology?

Foundational interests + inspirations:

  * distributed + serverless computing
  * bayesian statistics
  * [sparse coding](http://www.rctn.org/bruno/papers/highly-overcomplete-SPIE.pdf)
  * [capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06818)
  * microservice architectures (mostly K8s)
  * early 1800s American history and the great inventors
  * [coding schemes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283929v1.full.pdf)  w.r.t biological sequence 
  * [information theory + evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13475)
