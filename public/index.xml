      <description>The convergence of laboratory automation, high-throughput assays, and machine learning is moving the medium of biological discovery to silicon.
Bench top experimentation will be the machine code of the biological programmer, simple instructions that are executed by robotics just as bytes are fed through a compiler.
However, if the goal of creating arbitrary synthetic life is to be realized, we need to upgrade our tooling. We will need robust software that operates at the abstraction level of the organism.</description>

      <description>I am dedicating my life to making biology easier to engineer.
I both want to understand how the world works at its core and build huge systems that change how we interact (or think) about living things.
I studied Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at Berkeley. I dropped out to work on a stealth startup with pre-seed investment from Lucy Guo , the House , and Tyler Cowen .</description>
